### How to Use

There's a show/hide toggle in the Journal Notes tool layer:

Use the forward/back buttons to change the time, or drag the sun/moon icon (non-GM users will not have these controls):

You can position the window anywhere you like with the drag handle at the bottom, or pin it just above the Players list:

For each scene, you can choose how much of the display can be seen by Players, and whether or not to link the time to the scene's Darkness Level:

If you have [About Time](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/about-time) enabled, you can choose to sync with its time and date. Clicking on the time will toggle the date display; Shift-clicking the time will toggle the realtime clock (as configured in About Time).

If you have [Simple Calendar](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) enabled, make sure its sync setting is on "Mixed", and also click its "Export to About Time" button to start the sync. Calendar and time info from there should now sync up with SmallTime, though I don't currently support nonstandard time divisions.

### Settings

There are a number of settings you can change:

...including custom sunrise/sunset times, and global maximum & minimum darkness levels:

I'm happy to accept and implement more translations!
